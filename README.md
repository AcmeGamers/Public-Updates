# Repositories

A Full list of all the repositories can be seen in the link below. (Yes, I have yet to make it so I need some time to do that :'))

## Text To HTML Converter
Converts your text to html directly, requires more features to be added, which will be added soon after I'm done with a project.

# Public Updates About Myself

Updating some completely off-topic stuff about me (and useful updates on things) cause why not?

## Chaning Profile Pic

And this will be the most absurd thing you are gonna see (I think).

- Updated last pfp from 2019 - 20/12/2021
- - Now practically ngl, this image comes from 2015 [have been using it since then on many places], but made this github account in 2019 ^^'


## Notice

Don't worry at all, it won't be just some silly updates, there will be more updates which would be useful and not be _silly, like the second commit_, but hey, it is good to enjoy while we are it ^^
